## 📌 Project Overview

An **AI-powered content-based video game recommendation system** that leverages **multimodal deep learning (text + images)** and **cross-modal retrieval using CLIP** to recommend similar games — even in **cold-start scenarios**.

Traditional recommendation systems rely heavily on user ratings or interaction history, which often fail for **new users** or **new games**.  
This project solves that problem by using **game content itself**:

- 📄 **Text** → Game descriptions & genres  
- 🖼️ **Images** → Game posters  
- 🔀 **Multimodal embeddings** → Semantic similarity  
- 🔗 **CLIP** → Image-to-text recommendation  

The final system is deployed as an **interactive Streamlit web application**.

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ Content-based recommendations (no user data required)
- ✅ Multimodal learning (text + image)
- ✅ Cross-modal image → game search using CLIP
- ✅ Cold-start friendly
- ✅ Scalable embedding-based design
- ✅ Interactive Streamlit UI
- ✅ Production-ready deployment setup

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Stage 1: Prototype & Validation
- Small dataset to verify pipeline correctness

### Stage 2: Multimodal Embedding Generation
- **BERT** → Text embeddings  
- **ResNet50** → Image embeddings  
- **Fusion** → Final game embedding  

### Stage 3: Cross-Modal CLIP Retrieval
- CLIP text embeddings (offline)
- Image → Text similarity search

### Deployment
- **Streamlit**
- **Render**

---

## 🔍 Recommendation Modes

### 1️⃣ Text-Based Recommendation
- Select a game
- System finds similar games using **multimodal embeddings**
- Similarity measured using **cosine similarity**

### 2️⃣ Image-Based Recommendation (CLIP)
- Upload a game image
- CLIP encodes the image
- Matches it against CLIP text embeddings of games
- Returns visually and semantically similar games

---

## 🧪 Technologies Used

### 🔹 Core ML / DL
- **BERT** – Text understanding
- **ResNet50** – Visual feature extraction
- **CLIP (ViT-B/32)** – Cross-modal learning
- **Transfer Learning** – Frozen encoders

### 🔹 Libraries
- `numpy`, `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `torch`, `torchvision`
- `clip (OpenAI)`
- `streamlit`

### 🔹 Deployment

##🚀 How to Run Locally
```
1️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

2️⃣ Run the App
streamlit run app.py



🧠 Design Decisions

Precomputed embeddings → Fast inference

No heavy ML libraries at runtime → Lightweight deployment

Cosine similarity → Ideal for high-dimensional embeddings

CLIP → Enables image-based recommendation without labels

Clean separation of stages → Industry-style ML system design
